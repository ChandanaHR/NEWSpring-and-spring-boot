1. What is Spring Framework
   Spring is a lightweight, open-source, Java-based framework used to build enterprise applications.
    It provides a powerful infrastructure for developing robust, loosely-coupled, and testable applications.
Robust : Robust means strong, stable, and able to handle problems without failing.
         A system is robust if it can work correctly even when things go wrong.
         An application that:
            doesn’t crash when input is wrong
            handles errors properly
            keeps running even under heavy load
            can recover from failures
            If a user enters letters instead of numbers in a form, a robust system shows validation error—not crash.
        Java is called robust because:
              It has strong memory management
              Garbage collector prevents memory leaks
              Exception handling prevents crashes
              Strict compile-time checking

1a Why spring was needed?
  Before Spring, developers used:
      Java EE / J2EE (Servlets, JSP, EJBs)
      Heavy, complex configurations (XML everywhere!)
      Hard-to-test applications
      Tight coupling between components
Spring solved these issues by offering:
      Lightweight architecture
      Loose coupling with Dependency Injection (DI)
      Easy testing
      Modular design

1b) Tight Coupling:
    Two classes are tightly coupled when:
          one class is highly dependent on another
          changes in one class force changes in the other
          classes are directly creating or controlling each other
    import java.io.*;
    import java.util.*;
    import java.lang.*;
    
    public class Main
    {
        public static class First {
            Second obj = new Second();
            void print() {
                obj.display();
            }
        }
        public static class Second {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Second class");
            }
        }
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
    		First obj1 = new First();
    		obj1.print();
    	}
    }
Class First creates and controls second class - High dependency
If class second changes class first also should be modified
Class second is highly dependent on class first

1c) Loose coupling:
    Two classes are loosely coupled when:
        they depend on interfaces/abstractions, not concrete classes
        changes in one class do NOT require changes in another
        dependencies are provided from outside (DI – Dependency Injection)
code:
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

interface Payment {
    void makepayment();
}
public class Main
{
    public static class googlepay implements Payment {
        public void makepayment() {
            System.out.println("Payment using googlepay");
        }
    }
     public static class phonepay implements Payment {
        public void makepayment() {
            System.out.println("Payment using phonepay");
        }
    }
    public static class Shoppingservice {
        private Payment payment;
        Shoppingservice(Payment payment) {
            this.payment = payment;
        }
        void checkout() {
            payment.makepayment();
        }
    }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Shoppingservice service1 = new Shoppingservice(new googlepay());
		service1.checkout();
		Shoppingservice service2 = new Shoppingservice(new phonepay());
		service2.checkout();
	}
}
Note:
Interface methods are public ,if u implement those methods in other classes it should be public
